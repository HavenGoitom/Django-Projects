# 💊 MedMinder 🕒

*A Django-powered reminder app so you never forget your meds (or your sanity).*

## 🧠 What Is This?

Welcome to **MedMinder**, your friendly neighborhood fullstack Django app!
This web app keeps track of all your medicines — because your memory has already failed you enough. 🧓💭

With **built-in authentication** (yes, real logins!) and a full CRUD system, you can:

* ✍️ **Sign up** to create your very own account
* 🔐 **Log in** and feel exclusive (you earned it)
* 💾 **Add** your meds like a responsible adult
* 📃 **View** all your medicines so you can pretend you're organized
* ✏️ **Update** dosages when your doc plays mix-and-match
* ❌ **Delete** a medicine (because you’re healed or just rebellious)

---

## 🧪 Features

### 🧍 User Stuff

* 👤 **Signup page + API** – New users can join the party
* 🔑 **Login page + API** – You shall pass (if you have the right password)
* 🔒 Session-based auth – JWTs are cool, but we’re going old-school for now

---

### 💊 Medicine Management

On your **account dashboard**, you'll see:

📥 A simple form to enter your medicine data:

* **Medicine Name** (e.g. “Vitamin C” 🍊)
* **Dosage** – Could be `1 tablet`, `5ml`, or `whatever the doc said`
* **Frequency** – Like `twice a day`, `every 6 hours`, or `when I remember`

📋 A list of all your medicines so you can keep track like a boss.
🛠 You can **edit** or **delete** anything — you’re in control.

### ⏰ Bonus Round: The Reminder Bot

* A **cron job** or scheduled task (like Celery Beat) will **email or text you** to take your meds.
* Because let’s face it, remembering is not your strong suit. 😅📲

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* 🐍 **Python 3**
* 🌐 **Django** (Fullstack Framework of Awesomeness™)
* 🎨 **HTML/CSS** (Because pretty matters)
* 🗃 **SQLite** or PostgreSQL (pick your poison)
* 💌 **Email Service** (for reminders)

---
